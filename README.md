# Ninja-Yubaraj's Wallpaper Collection 

Possibly the most common question I get from anyone who have seen my Desktop is
"Hey, can you give me a link to your wallpaper?"  Well,I have collected these wallpapers over a number of years and have no idea where I got most of them.  I have also renamed them all (giving them a number) so I don't even have their original filename.  So I am uploading my entire wallpaper directory for those that want/need them. 

## Where Did I Get These?

I find wallpapers in a number of different locations but good places to check out include [Imgur](http://imgur.com), [/wg/](http://4chan.org/wg), [wallhaven](https://wallhaven.cc/) and [Pixiv](https://www.pixiv.net/).  Some of the wallpapers were probably included in default wallpaper packages from various Linux distributions that I have installed over the years.

## Style of Wallpapers

The vast majority of these wallpapers are nature, tech, anime, game and landscape photos.  There are a few abstract art wallpapers mixed in.

## Ownership

Because I downloaded most of these from sites listed above, I have no way of knowing if there is a copyright on these images. If you find an image hosted in this repository that is yours and of limited use, please let me know in the [Issues](https://github.com/Ninja-Yubaraj/Wallpapers/issues) and I will remove it.

## About License

"Since I don't have any idea of the origins of most these Wallpapers, I can not distribute them under any kind of Free or even some Proprietary License without proper consent."

Still after that being said, I dont think using them as "Wallpapers" for ricing some DE or WM won't hurt that much, and is kind of a mild issue. So We everyone use them as long as anyone don't have a problem with it.
